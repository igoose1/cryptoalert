Example
=======

sample.hjson file is

	[
		{
			symbol: ETH
			when: >2000
		}
		{
			symbol: ETH
			when: <100
		}
		{
			symbol: BTC
			when: >15000
		}
		{
			symbol: ZEC
			when: >60
		}

		// I don't believe in USDT.
		{
			symbol: USDT
			when: <0.9
		}
		{
			symbol: USDT
			when: >1.1
		}
	]

Launch script like this

	key="1234-5678-..." python echo.py < sample.hjson

Possible output is

	BTC costs more than it was expected. Its current price is 33444.1234 USD.
	ZEC costs more than it was expected. Its current price is 85.1267 USD.

Nothing is being said about ETH and USDT as their price is not in specified
limits. Nothing can be printed as well.
